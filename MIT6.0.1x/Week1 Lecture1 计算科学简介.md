### **计算科学简介**
计算方法和计算思维的原则
####Goal：**Becoming skillful at making a computer do what you want it to do**
**learn computational modes of thinking**
####what does a computer do?
**Fundamentally**
Performs calculations
remembers the results
**what calculations?**
built in primitives
creating our own methods of calculating

simple calculation + Good algorithm design
limitation:speed,storage,complex problems like accurate weather prediction at a local scale and cracking encryptio schemes+fundamentally impossible probles
**turing halting problem**
**problems**
> A computational mode of thinking means that everything can be viewed as a math problem involving numbers and formulas.


**computational problem solving**
computation?
declarative knowledge :statements of fact(to **test** or judge)
imperative knowledge:"**how to**"methods or recipes test+calcution+flow
algorithms are recipes

basic machine architecture
how to capture a recipe int a mechanical process?
fixed program computers like calculatorand computer for systems of linear equations
a machine that stores and manipulates instructions=stored prigram computer
store srqyence if instrctions
interpreter use tests change the flow to control

program counter: points the computer to the next instruction to execute in the program
alu basic primitives
six compute anything **turing complete**
abstract methods
anything computable in one language is computable in any other programming


programming language characteristics
creating recipes
each programming language provides a set of **primitive operations**
**combining** primitives to form more complex but legal expressions
**dedicing** meanings or values associated with computations or expressions 
**aspects fo languages**
primitice constructs
**syntax** well-formed?valid? Determines whether a string is **legal**
**static semantics** which syntactically valid **strings have a meaning**
**sematics** always have exactly one meaning
Assigns a meaning to a legal sentence.
**where can things go wrong?**
syntacic errors
static semantic errors
meaning may not be what was intended like crashes,runs forever,produces an answer but not intend
**our goal**
learn the syntax and semantics of a programming language
learn hou to use those elements to translate recipes for solving a problem into a form that the computer can use to do the work.
computational modes of thought enable us to use a suite of methods
