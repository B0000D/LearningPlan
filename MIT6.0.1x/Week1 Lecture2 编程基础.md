**Python**
##**Programming language**
###**Goal**
> Need a way to describe algorithmic steos such that computer can use them to execute process

> Programming language define syntax and semantics needed to translate our computational ideas into mechanical steps

**low level language** similar to internal control unit:
move data from one location to another
execute a simple ALU operation
jump to new point in sequence based on test

**hign level language** fast
uses more abstract terms like invert a matrix and compute a function
first comverted back into low level instrcuctions then executed

**interpreted language** easier to find error
special program converts source code to internal data structure,then converted into low level machine instruction and executes
like **Python**

---
###**Python objects**
**Pyhton programs**
a sequence of definitions and commands
definitions and evaluated and commands executed by Python interpreter in a shell.
Can be typed directly into a shell or stored in a file that is read into the shell and evaluated.

Scalar objects
int 3 
float 3.0
bool True

Expressions
