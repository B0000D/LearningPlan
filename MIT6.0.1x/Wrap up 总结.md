## computational thinking 
### computer scientists
> * **thinking computationally**
abstractions algorithms automated execution
> * reading riting rithmetic
### the process
> * identify or invent useful absractions
suppress the details
> * formulate solution to a problem as a **computational experiment** using abstractions
> * design and construct a sufficiently efficient implementation of experiment
> * validate experimental setup(debug)
> * run experiment
> * evaluate results of experiment
> * repeat as needed
### three 'A's
> * Abstraction
> * Automation
> * Algorithms
### more
> * difficulty
> * thinking recursively

## where have you been?
### five major tpics
> * Python
> * Systematic
> * complexity
> * abstraction
> * algorithms
### Why Python?
> * easy to learn and use
simple syntax
interpretive,easy to debug
managing memory not needed
> * Modern
object-oriented
> * Increasingly popular
growing set of libraries
### courses
> * write test dubug
> * **pseudo code**
> * take a step at a time
> * **overall structures**
### Estimating complexity
> * Big O notation
> * Recgnizing common patterns of compitation
> * **Learning to map problems into templates of solutions**
### From problem statement to computation
> * Break the problem into a series of smaller problems
> * try and relate problem to a problem you or sombody else have already solved
> * what kind of output?
> * how to approximate solutions
### algorithms
> * different kinds of algotiehms
> * Specific algorithms
## Where are you headed?
return on investment
writing programs
### what to do next?
> * 6.00.2x
> * Introductory algorithms and data strutures
> *Introduction to artifical intelligence
> *Software engineering
> * computer architecture
